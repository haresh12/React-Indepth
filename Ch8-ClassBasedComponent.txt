Chapter - 7 :  Class based component

>>>> FIRST THING FIRST CLASS BASED COMPONENT ARE NO LONGER USED

>>>> MI IMPORTANT THING ABOUT CLASS BASED COMPONENT IS RENDER METHOD WE CAN NOT CREATE CLASS BASED COMPONENT WITHOUT RENDER METHOD.

>>>> IN CLASS BASED COMPONENT RENDER METHOD RETURNS SOME JSX.

>>>>> IN CLASS BASED COMPONENT WE GET PROPS USING this.props WHERE IN FUNCTIONAL BASED COMPONENT WE WERE GETTING LIKE (props) HERE MI LEARN ABOUT
      CLASS BASED COMPONENT AS WE ALREADY HAVE IDEA ABOUT FUNCTIONAL BASED COMPONENT

>>>>> WHY DO WE DO super(props) IN constructor in  CLASS BASED COMPONENT.

>>> IN CLASS BASED COMPONENT ALL THE STATE VARIABLE COMPONENT ARE CREATED AS ONE OBJECT LIKE : 

    // THIS ONE IS CORRECT
     this.state ={
      name : "Haresh",
      count : 2
     }

     /// THIS ONE IS WRONG DODO USE STATE NHI NHI HOTA HAI BHAI ESA
       this.state ={
        name : "Haresh"
     }
       this.state ={
       count : 2 
     }


>>>> DO NOT MAKE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN TAG BUTTON IS NOT SELF CLOSING TAG BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WRITE TITLE THEN YOU HAVE TO WRITE BETWEEN 
     OPENING AND CLOSING TAG. <button>Search</button> like this.

>>> AND ALSO WE NEVER MUTED STATE VARIABLE DIRECTLY BECAUSE REACT WILL RE RENDER DOM ONLY IF YOU DO IT WITH SET STATE.

>>> IN REACT LIFE CYCLE FIRST THE CONSTRUCOR IS CALLED AND THEN ONLY RETURN FUNCTION WILL BE CALLED

>>>> ComponentDidMount in class based component is similer to useEffect in functional based component because it be also called after render method

>>>  FIRST TIME I CAME TO KNOW THAT CONSTRUCOR ANR RENDER ARE THE LIFE CYCLE method.

>>> FIRST OF ALL CONSTRUCOR GET CALLED
>>> THEN COMPONENT RENDER
>>  THEN COMPONENT DID MOUNT GET CALLED


>>>> NOW UNDERSTAND BY LOGIC WHY ITS IMPORTANT THAT COMPONENT DID MOUNT IS GETTING CALLED THIRD BECAUSE  REACT SAYS FIRST RENDER ATLEAST WITH
     DEFAULT STATE AND THEN ONLY RENDER WITH APIS DATA SO USER CAN SEE SOMETHING ATLEAST WITH INITIAL STATE


 >>>> THIS IS THE BEST THING TILL NOW CREATE TWO CLASS BASED COMPONENT ONE PARENT ONE CHILD NOW LET US KNOW IN WHICH ORDER THERE METHODS WILL BE CALLED

      1. Parent constructor
      2. Parent Render 
         (See now in parent render we have child component so it will  render all the methods of child and then again it will go to parent)
        3. Child constructor
        4.Child Render
        5 Child ComponentDidMount (This one was confusing)
     6.Parent ComponentDidMount
       

  >>>>> ABOVE THING IS MUCH MUCH MUCH INSTRESTING WHEN WE HAVE MULTIPLE CHILDREN MAKE SURE NO MATTER WHAT ITS ALWAYS ALWAYS  GOING TO CALL
        CONSTRUCOR DID MOUNT. (OMG JUST WATCH VIDEO).


  >>>> REACT DOES THAT IN TWO FACES FIRST IS RENDER FACE AND SECOND ONE IS COMMIT FACE   ::::: (RENDER) :::::: (COMMIT)    


  >>>> RENDER FACE INCLUDE YOUR CONSTRUCOR AND RENDER METHOD  AND COMMIT FACE IS THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY UPDATE THE DOM


  >>>>> NEED TO LEARN THIS WE CAN DO  COMPONENT DID MOUNT FUNCTION ASYNC BUT WE CAN NOT MAKE USEEFFECT ASYNC


  >>>>> THREE STATE : MOUNTING , UPDATING AND UNMOUNTING   : RE RENDERING FACE IS KNOW IS UPDATING
