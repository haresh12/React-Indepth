Chapter - 5 : Lets Get Hooked

>> React File Structure : https://hu.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html go thorugh it see even react does not have any recommended why to 
  structure file but in this blog they are explaining some good structure that are used in ecosystem

>>>> Named export and default export i have good idea on both so no need to to write more about it  but understand this that we can export default only
     one component from file if you have multiple then rest should be named export. 

     Default : export default Header;
     Named : export {Title, SubTitle};


>>> ONE INTERSTING THING LEARNED TODAY THAT SUPPOSE YOU HAVE 10 DIFFERENT COMPONENT TO EXPORT NOW TILL NOW WE WHERE DOING LIKE 
    import {Title , SubTitle} for path
    BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY WE CAN DO THIS
    import * as Obj from path ; This will import all the export component that we have and then we can use like
    <Obj.Title/> <Obj.SubTitle/> Great thing really useful    


 >>> ONE MORE INTERSTING THING LEARNED TODAY ITS ABOUT FILE EXTENTION THAT .JS ================ .JSX WHAT I WAS THING THAT IF ANYTIME WE
     WANT TO YOU PEICE OF JSX IN OUR FILE THEN IT SHOULD BE ALWAYS JSX BUT NO THIS IS NOT THE CASE WE CAN HAVE .JS ALSO BUT BIG QUESTION
     COMES THAT WHY I WAS GETTING ERROR IN TIGER21 PROJECT IT MUST BE ESLINT SETTINGS.


>>>> ONE MORE THING TO LEARN THAT REACT USES ONE WAY DATA BINDING (LEARN MORE ABOUT IT BEST EXAMPLE REACT INPUT)

>>> See whenver you take const [text,setText] then this text is known as state variable. (Make sense because value
   of this variable is depend on state)

>>>> HOOKS ARE JUST NORMAL FUNCTION

>>> IF WE ARE USING CONST THEN HOW WE ARE ABLE TO CHANGE VALUE OF STATE VARIABLE I HAD THIS QUESTION IN MY MIND FROM
    LAST 50000 YEARS BUT FROM ABOVE ONE LINE WHICH IS HOOKS ARE JUST NORMAL FUNCTION I GOT MY ANSWER CLEAR LIKE 
    ANYTHING. SEE THIS FUNCTION IT SELF RETURN ARRAY AND WHICH FIRST VALUE AS LOCAL VARIABLE AND SECOND ONE IS 
    setSomething WHICH WE USE TO SET VALUE THAT MEANS WE ARE NOT CHANGING ANY VALUE DIRECTLY BUT WE ARE MODIFYING 
    SOME VALUES OF THAT ARRAY.


 >>> WHY DO WE NEED STATE ?

     SEE IN SIMPLE TERM ANSWER IS TO LET REACT KNOW THAT IT NEED TO RENDER DOM AGAIN BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE
     VARIABLES AND YOU UPDATE THERE VALUE LIKE XYZ=100 THEN REACT REALLY DOES NOT HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT WHETHER
     IT NEEDS TO UPDATE THE DOM OR NOT AND THATS WHERE STATE COMES INTO PICTURE AND WHICH HELPS REACT TO KNOW 
     THAT DOM KO RENDER KRNE KA TIME AA GYA HAI
