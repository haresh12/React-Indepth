1. Is React is library or framework ?
>> React is library why because it takes minimum efforts to setup react and and its like other npm packages you can simply us use in any project given
   the example suppose we are building large application and in that large application for some part we would like to use React then we can simply add
   react library our entire project is not should be react for that. On other hand thing about React Native which is framework because it is build 
   specific for mobile app development.


>>> Bracket Pair Colorization Toggler (Use this extension good one from brackets)


2. What is Emmet in vs code ? (Good one)
>> Emmet uses different abbreviations and short expressions depending on what's passed, and then dynamically converts the abbreviations into the full code. 
   Emmet is mostly used for HTML, XML, and CSS, but it can also be used with programming languages.

   How to add : 
   Open the VS Code settings (Code → Preferences → Settings) and search for “Emmet Extensions Path”. Click “Add Item”, enter the path to the 
   folder where you've saved the snippets. json file you've created earlier and press “OK”


3. What is CDN ?
>> CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It's a network of servers located around the world that are designed to improve 
   the speed and reliability of delivering digital content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other files, to users.

   When you access a website or app, your device requests the content from the server that hosts the website or app.
   With a CDN, instead of the server directly delivering the content to your device,the CDN acts as a middleman,
   delivering the content from a server that is geographically closer to you.

>> Why above cdn question came in mind because see this is how we are using react for alteast so below two links
   are basically CDN links.

  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  

4. What is crossorigin ?
 >>> crossorigin is an attribute that can be used in various HTML tags such as img, audio, video, link, and script.
    
    It is used to control how the browser handles requests for resources that are located on a different domain
    or origin than the website or application that is making the request. This is known as a cross-origin request.

    The value of the crossorigin attribute can be set to "anonymous" or "use-credentials" depending on
    the requirements of the resource being requested and the security needs of the website or application 
    making the request.

    Setting crossorigin to "anonymous" indicates that the resource being requested does not require any 
    user authentication information or cookies to be included in the request. This can be useful when 
    requesting resources like scripts or images that are hosted by a third-party domain or CDN.

    On the other hand, setting crossorigin to "use-credentials" indicates that the resource being 
    requested requires user authentication information or cookies to be included in the request.
    This is typically used when making requests to APIs or services that require user authentication.

    >> YOU SEE IN ABOVE SCRIPT WE ARE NEITHER PASSING anonymous NOR PASSING use-credentials so is that 
       even helpful.

      By including the crossorigin attribute in the script tag without specifying a value, 
      you're telling the browser that the requested resource (https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js) 
      may be subject to cross-origin restrictions and that CORS should be enabled.

     The browser will then determine the appropriate CORS settings based on the resource being 
     requested and the security needs of your web application.


>>>> See after add above two script we got access of react yes you heard it right no need to do create-react-app
     no node modules or nothing just these two line are enough to access react. Its like in js we get access of
     window object in browser console same way try to use React you will able to see all the function and properties
     of it.
