Chapter - 6 : Explore the world

>>> WE NEED TO KEEP OUR UI TO SYNC WITH STATE AND THATS WHY WE NEED HOOKS. HOOKS is the way to let React DOM know what something is updated in UI
    so it can re render it again

>>>> React tracks only state variable for re rendering

>>> If you have one component and you have states in that then with each states changes entire component get re render but react only updates whats changes
    in that state try to minimize the use of states in single component and try to make component as small as you can.


>>> understanding basic about microservices : In simple word create smaller project for each different part example one that handles notification
    and then one that handles authentication and many others this is basically separation of concerns.

>> UseEffect second hook that we are going learn : (I already i have good idea so will only write that i don't know)    

   understand all hook are named import it make sense

>>> There are two possible cases when your component renders first if any state changes or ALSO ANY Props changes.

>>> When passed no dependency in UseEffect then i know it will be called one but NEW THING TO LEARN HERE IS IT WILL 
    BE CALLED AFTER INITIAL RENDER



>>>> ALLOW CORS : LEARN MORE ABOUT IT AND ALLOW CORS PLUGIN
