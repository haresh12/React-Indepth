Chapter : 2 Igniting The App

>> First time i created package.json with npm init incredible thing else if you do create react app you have all this setup by default.

>> Understood what is different between dependencies and devDependencies.

>> Things that parcel does for us. (Amazing stuff)

   BUNDLING (MUST REMEMBER THIS ATLEAST BECAUSE THIS IS WHY WE CALL IT BUNDLER)
   HMR : Hot module reloading 
   Catching
   Code MINIFY
   Tree shaking
   Image optimization
   File watcher algorithm (Because of that changes get updated as soon as we save)
   Compression 
   HTTPS on dev (incredible thing real man just with one command npx parcel index.html -- https)
   Compatible with older browser (Basically browserlist library handles this but parcel use it internally)
   Cleaning your code (Example remove all console.log in prod build)
   Port number (I always thought this one handles by react it self but i was wrong)
   Consistent hashing algorithm
   ZERO CONFIG (Best part of parcel that you don't have to do any configuration or may be any minor configuration)

 These are the main thing that parcel do for us so thanks from heart for such Amazing repository.
