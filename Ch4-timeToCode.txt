Chapter : 4 talk in cheap show me the code  

>>>> First few thing we need to understand that with React below things are not mandatory
    1. Use of JSX => Not mandatory
    2. Use of TypeScript => Not mandatory
    3. Use of ES6 => Not mandatory


>>> Also good thing about react is you can use it for smaller part of your app also if you don't want to use for entire project
    suppose you have one web project now for just footer you want to use React then we can do that all we have to do is user
    React.createRoot() and pass the id of root element. then use root.render(and pass you footer component here)


>>>  Here in below code learn more about anchor tag new for me 
      <a href="/"> 
      <img alt="logo" className="logo" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMf9w4RomHXrUkQKvrxtPdjp3SLadP05HDzXlH2=w1080-h608-p-no-v0"/> 
      </a> 


>>> React.Fragment or <> </> this empty tag both are the more good then what i thought so as we know that we are using this when ever we have multiple 
    tags and we need to wrap then but you know when you will use <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment> and put your sibling component inside this one
    then just do to console and see you html dom you WON'T SEE ANY EXTRA TAG.


>>> For styling you can use inline style or className or one new way which i used in past project is style attribute like <div style={style}/>    

>>>>> IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT I MUST NEED TO TAKE FROM THIS LECTURE IS SOMETHING CALLED "CONFIG DRIVEN UI MUST USED CONCEPT IN ALL BIG APPS FOR SURE"
      TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT JUST SEE HOW SWIGGY SEND DATA OF RES LIST : https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=23.0711832&lng=72.6417774&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING
      IN SIMPLE TERMS IT MEANS LIKE SHOWING YOUR UI BASED ON CONFIG THAT ARE SENT BY BACKEND

>>>> Next thing to learn here is Virtual DOM : (If you understand this then you will ALWAYS GOING TO USE KEY)  

>>>> NEW THING LEARNED TODAY THAT VIRTUAL DOM IS NOT CONCEPT OF REACT IT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONCEPT REACT JUST USED AS SEEN OPPORTUNITY IN IT

>>> VIRTUAL DOM : WE KEEP THE REPRESNTION OF OUR DOM WITH US WHICH IS KNOW AS VIRTUAL DOM AND WE NEED VIRTUAL DOM IN REACT FOR SOMETHING CALLED
    RECONSOLITION WHERE REACT CHECK DIFF BETWEEN TWO VIRTUAL DOM AND RENDER DATA AFTER SEEING THE DIFFERENT SEE THIS IS BIG TOPIC AND MOST 
    ASKED INTERVIEW CONCEPT LETS WRITE BLOG ON THIS BY END OF WEEK
