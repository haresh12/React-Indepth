         how the hell its getting <h1> in browser console. (Yep will soon understand this in

         h1 tags and then you are rendering this reactHeading in root question is would it append it or just
         replace it ? Answer is react will replace it means all those h1 tags will be gone now and this new one
         will be render in reactRoot. (ASKED IN INTERVIEW ALSO)
