Chapter - 7 : Lets find the path

>> UseEffect is called after you component is rendered. We basically need to pass two perameters into that first is callback function and second
   one is dependency array.

   >>> Now question is what if we don't pass dependency array ? 

       THIS IS THE GREAT THING I LEARNED TODAY THAT IF YOU DON'T PASS EVEN EMPTY ARRAY IN UseEffect THEN IT WILL BE CALLED ON EACH RENDER DO YOU THAT 
       IS LIKE DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR OF ANY CODE OUTSIDE OF THAT HOOK BECAUSE THAT CODE IS ALSO GET EXECUTED AFTER EACH RENDER AND THEN WE MOST OF
       THE TIME WE PASS EMPTY ARRAY dependency THAT MEANS JUST CALLED IT ONCE. HERE IMPORTANT THING TO LEARN IS NOT PASSING EMPTY ARRAY ALSO
       AND THEN SEE THE BEHAVIOUR.


>>>>> REACT DOCUMENTATION SAYS THAT NEVER NEVER MEANS NEVER CREATE THE COMPONENT INSIDE COMPONENT.

>>>>  NEVER EVER WRITE YOUR useState INSIDE IF ELSE CONDITION. (I DON'T KNOW WHO DOES THAT) ALSO NEVER WRITE INSIDE FOR LOOP.

>>> NEVER USE HOOKS OUTSIDE OF COMPONENT (REALLY ALL THREE POINTS I NEVER DID)

>>>> REACT DOES LIKE INCONSITANCY YOUR COMPONENT SHOULD ALWAYS NOW WHAT IT WILL BE DOING.


>>>>  LEARN WHY WE NEED TO STORE IMAGES IN CDN ?

>>>>> Array(10).fill("") easiest way to create array.
